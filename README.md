 ## Setup
 
```
//setup guide coming...you will need to create a firebase project and set up email/password auth. 
//For fetching player statistics you need to setup a rapidapi account and get a key from https://rapidapi.com/elreco/api/call-of-duty-modern-warfare
//If you want to enable notifications you need to add cloud functions, to do that you need to
//change project billing to to blaze plan.
