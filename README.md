- Use grid instead of flex for the parent container of sidebar+page-content+widgets
- Make the mobile screen size more user firendly
- Upgrade Firebase version so that we can install firebase-hooks in order to render loading indicator while verifying user.
- Error in the console when refreshing the site on the profile page
